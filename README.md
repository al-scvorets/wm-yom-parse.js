# wm-yom-parse.js
is a translator from the mysterious but human-readable language Yom into less misterious but computer-readable javascript object.  

## When to use it

The scope of application is not yet clear. Perhaps this scope is endless.

## How to use it

```
<script src="wm-html-include.js"> </script>
<script>
    var jsObj =                         // the result is common js data object. You even can JSON.stringify it
      window.wmYomParse (source_data);  // the source is some text on the mysterious language Yom
</script>
```

## Examples
* To be done. Soon
